SUFFIX ARRAY
---
It is the question on the suffix Array(built from scratch) in O(nlogn) using the radix sort(if you use the STL sort then time
complexity becomes O(nlognlogn).

Also built the LCP(longest common prefix array) to solve 2nd part and the 3rd part.



Nth_nofaUnsortedArray.cpp
---

It is implementation of nth_element() STL function which finds nth element in O(n) in unsorted array.

Run with exe file and then enter the no. of elements and then nth element you want to find. At last this file will compare with STL function.

Assumption: all the elements are distinct.

Time complexity: O(n)
